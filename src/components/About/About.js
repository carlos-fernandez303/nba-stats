            The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional
            basketball league in North America. The league is composed of 30
            teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the
            four major professional sports leagues in the United States and
            Canada. It is the premier men's professional basketball league in
            the world. The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946,
            as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). It changed its name
            to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after
            merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL). The
            NBA's regular season runs from October to April, with each team
            playing 82 games. The league's playoff tournament extends into June.
            As of 2020, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by
            average annual salary per player. The NBA is an active member of USA
            Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by the FIBA (International
            Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball
            in the United States. The league's several international as well as
            individual team offices are directed out of its head offices in
            Midtown Manhattan, while its NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios
            are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey. In
            North America, the NBA is the third wealthiest professional sport
            league after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League
            Baseball (MLB) by revenue, and among the top four in the world. The
            Milwaukee Bucks are the reigning champions, having beaten the
            Phoenix Suns 4â€“2 in the 2021 Finals.
